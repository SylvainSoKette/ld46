# Ludum Dare 46 : Keep it alive

[Hello there !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc&t=8) Stay awhile and listen ! This is my first game using the Godot Engine. In fact, I just tried the engine 3 days before ! It feels fantastic so I'll be sticking with it for some times :)

Made for Ludum Dare 46 in 48h, sleeping well, eating 2 chinese takeout, some lettuce and cheese sandwich and petting a cat (a lot).
